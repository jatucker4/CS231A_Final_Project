# CS231A_Final_Project

The code in this repository was taken from the original semantic abstraction code base found here: https://github.com/columbia-ai-robotics/semantic-abstraction

My contributions include the project_ovssc.py and project_vool.py files. To reproduce my results simply follow the link above to set up SemAbs and run these two files.
